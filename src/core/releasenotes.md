    - Now uses `MapPin.vue` and `MapPinUser.vue` instead of HTML-strings!

## Bug Fixes: 

## Breaking Changes & Migration Notes:



# Version 22.3 (2022-MAY-18)

## Bug Fixes: 
- patternlock: include pattern code on success emit
- removed `fg.state.cardAnimation` completely -> from now on few animations are possible at same time 
- changed `core_styles.less` -> changed `active_card` / `previous_card` selectors to `.animation-card` / `.animation-previous-card` responsively -> transitions of card will not be connected to `cardStack`, and run smoothly to the end even if `cardStack` changes
- moved disconnect `MutationObserver` to a place right after Card was injected into DOM, prevents from having multiple `MutationObservers` at the same time

# Version 22.2 (2022-APR-20)

## What's new:
- Moved Swiper.css import from start.js to app.js/custom
- `ibeacon.js` really works now :) -> got refactored and tested with ibeacon touch
- `delay.option` in showCard and hideCard -> if you want to wait before show/hide card, because of animation or so -> use `delay.option`
- Refactor of `device` Module (and references in other modules) to camelCase

## Bug Fixes:
- added `will-change: transform;` to `SliderGallery.less` -> will cause Android glitches if missing
- Add `enableHighAccuracy: true` to map
- complete refactoring of `fg.core.showCard` and `fg.core.hideCard` because of animation bugs / glitches 

## Breaking Changes & Migration Notes:
- If you use swiperjs: Add `import 'swiper/swiper.less';` (or an other swiper style import) to your app.js
- due to refactor of `device.js`: check your `AudioplayerGlobal.js` -> headset detection must be camel cased.
    -  headset_connected -> headsetConnected
    - fg.m.Device.start_headset_detection -> fg.m.Device.startHeadsetDetection
- also check if you use fg.m.Device elsewhere in your custom code and still have snake case :)


# Version 22.1 (2022-FEB-23)

## What's new:
- `core.getGlossar` -> Works the same as `core.getStop` but for Glossar
- Added `relatedRecordId` to `logVisitorAction` as optional parameter

- SliderGallery: Added lockPortrait prop to activate/deactivate portrait lock in fullscreen mode, per default it's set to true (behaviour as usual)
- Quiz:
    - New Quiz Type -> Hotspot. Used to either find details on an image or to compare an image onsite with an image shown in the app.

## Bug Fixes: 
- SliderGallery: prevent image being distorted (zoomed in) in fullscreen if focal point feature was used in CMS.
- Map Component in DemoCard -> mapSettingsJSON component name was wrongly used in template -> changed to -> "map-settings-j-s-o-n"
- Map Component -> check in watcher if arrays did reeeeeally have changed

## Breaking Changes & Migration Notes:





# Version 21.5 (2021-DEC-22)

## What's new:
- Moved card imports out of `app.setttings.js` into (new) `card.js`

- VisitorTeam:
    - `fg.core.createVisitorTeam(object, boolean)` -> creates visitor team in `visitor_teams` DB
    - `fg.core.getVisitorTeam(visitorTeamIdJs)` ->  get visitor team from `visitor_teams` Table with visitoreamIdJs identifier. IMPORANT!!! -> The response data will be saved in `fg.state.visitor.visitorTeam` -> `visitorTeam` is from now on core preserved... Do not mess with it! :)
    - `fg.core.getVisitorTeams(timestampFrom)` -> get all visitor teams from `visitor_teams`. `timestampFrom` is an optional parameter -> defines from what creation time and above (till now) teams should be given. Ex.: timestamp for 25.11.2021 -> give me back all teams that were created from 25.11.2021 till now. IMPORTANT! USAGE -> This function is in `core.js` as boilerplate for you, copy + paste it in your custom code at a proper and the most important -> logical :) place. Respode to axios' success and error call in your custom code.
    - `fg.core.getAllVisitorsFromTeam(visitorTeamIdJs)` -> get `visitor.state` from all `visitors`, that belong to the same team. `visitorTeamIdJs` serves as identifier. IMPORTANT! USAGE -> This function is in `core.js` as boilerplate for you, copy + paste it in your custom code at a proper and the most important -> logical :) place. Respode to axios' success and error call in your custom code.
    
- Floorplan is now ready for proximi.io (indoor-positioning-system)
        - you need to install Proximi.io Cordova Plugin -> https://github.com/fluxguide/proximiio-cordova
        - use with Floorplan -> see Floorplan Component Guide in Notion & Demo 
            - new emits like: 
                - ```onProximiioReady(visitorId)```
                - ```onPositionChang(coords)```
                - ```onFloorChange(floor)```
        - use without Floorplan -> see https://github.com/fluxguide/proximiio-cordova

- Quiz:
    - New Quiz Type -> Puzzle. can be also used as solo component. One need to `npm i p5` in order for it to work. Puzzle image, Number of columns and rows can be defined as prop. Puzzle Theme can be also defined as prop.

- Toast messages:
    - Toast messages are accepting a type (string) now which results in a css class, possible types are: success, info, warning, error, default

## Bug Fixes: 

## Breaking Changes & Migration Notes:
- Create `cards.js` and create a `export default` (instead of `export const appCards = `) with the card-components (which were in `app.settings.js`)
- Change `app.settings.js` to a `export default` instead of `export const appSettings = `
- Add the properties `isDebuggingOn` and `contentDownloadEmulationFileTimeout` to `app.settings.js`

- `LanguageSelectScreen` -> changed into `LanguageSelection`... Check your `cards.js` and `fg.core.showCard('LanguageSelectScreen')` -> `fg.core.showCard('LanguageSelection')`
- `ContentDownloadScreen` -> changed into `ContentDownload`... Check your `cards.js` and `fg.core.showCard('ContentDownloadScreen')` -> `fg.core.showCard('ContentDownload')`

- VisitorTeam Logic -> Work in progress: New ```fg.core.createVisitorTeam``` -> creates a new visitor team in ```visitor_teams``` DB

## Breaking Changes & Migration Notes:
- if you use the Permissions Module in custom -> switch Functions to camelCase (zB `setPermission`)
- Change in audioplayer: when using multiple audioplayers in one vue-template -> they will now be initialized asynchronous (template and audio-object).
- ShowCard/HideCard - completely refactored
    - fg.core.cardStack removed
    - ```fg.state.cardStack = {}``` from now on card stack is an Object that lives in fg.state :)
    - Card Object structure:
        ```appCard, id, cardData, callback, animation, duration, activeCard, previousCard```
    - You can use card's structure in your show/hideCard functions like following:
        ```
            let cardOptions = { 
                animation: 'push-left',
                duration: 600,
                callback: function(){
                    fg.core.hideCard('HomeCard');
                }
                // you can add custom data for this card (e.g. which stop-id is this detail-card)
                stopID: 99
            }
            fg.core.showCard('StartMemoriesCard', cardOptions );
        ```
    - In show/hideCard it is important to specify cardId as first parameter, all other specs will be specified in options parameter
    - Duration of animations will be now be written only via JS, not CSS
    - card component (all your standart cards), have now access to following props:
        - cardData (e.g. cardData.stopID)

    - CSS ```core_styles.less``` card animations were also refactored and will not work with old type of showCard/hideCard
    - Added a helper function ```setCardStackActivePrevCard``` in core.js that will set active/previous cards' states
    - Added ```if(fg.state.cardAnimation) return; ```in showCard/hideCard ... so if there is a card transition, one can not open other card (otherwise glitchy glitchy :))

    - `fg.log_records` is now `fg.logRecords`
    - `fg.sync_queue` is now `fg.syncQueue`
    - `fg.sync_queue_offline` is now `fg.syncQueueOffline`

    ```
        export const appSettings = {
            ...
            cardTransitions: {
